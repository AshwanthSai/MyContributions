<h3>Sourcing data is the hardest part of the job. </h3> 
<ol> Logic is to fetch data from the absolute source. For example take mental illness, look for the national governing agency and download reports.
They will have the dataset embeded in it. </ol>
<ol> Key is to search with depth, for example do not search for poverty in america, search for poverty in chicago 2018 and the website will have the source listed somwhere.</ol> 
<ol> It was also observed that changing location from Australia to US using a VPN gave better search resutls. </ol> 

<h3> Absolute Sources </h3>
<ol>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - Firearm Data </ol>
<ol>FBI Crime Reports - Crime Related Data </ol>
<ol>Mental Illness - Mental Health America </ol>
<ol>Demographic - Census bureau. Finding indvidual links is inefficent
Use this dashboard, filter by state, county, year https://data.census.gov/all?q=poverty+in+2018
</ol>
